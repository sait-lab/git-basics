## Documents

Below are the links to the documents available in this repository. Each link provides a detailed guide on the respective topic.

### 1. [Git Basics](git-basics.md)
This document covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. You should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

### 2. [Git Branching](git-branching.md)
This document covers the way Git does branching. Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day. Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can entirely change the way that you develop.

### 3. [GitHub](github.md)
This document is about using GitHub effectively. We’ll cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub’s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.
